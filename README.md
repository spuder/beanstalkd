## Overview

This is a Puppet module to manage a Beanstalkd instance.

## Module Description

The Beanstalkd module handles installing, configuring, and running the Beanstalkd daemon.

## Setup

### What beanstalkd affects

* beanstalkd package

### Beginning with beanstalkd

`include 'beanstalkd'` is enough to get you up and running. If you'd like to
pass parameters, you can do something like this:

```puppet
class { 'beanstalkd':
  listen_addr      => '0.0.0.0',
  listen_port      => '11300',
  enable_binlog    => true,
  binlog_directory => '/var/lib/beanstalkd',
}
```
Or, you can use the same options in hiera:
```yaml
---
beanstalkd::listen_addr: '0.0.0.0'
beanstalkd::listen_port: '11300'
beanstalkd::enable_binlog: 'true'
